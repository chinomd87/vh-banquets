## 📱 **How to Use**

### **Basic Implementation:**

```javascript
import Shift4PaymentComponent from './Shift4PaymentComponent';

function EventPaymentPage({ event, client }) {
  const handlePaymentSuccess = (paymentData) => {
    console.log('Payment successful:', paymentData);
    // Update event payment status
    // Send confirmation email
    // Navigate to success page
  };

  const handlePaymentError = (error) => {
    console.error('Payment failed:', error);
    // Show error message
    // Log error for support
  };

  return (
    <div className="payment-container">
      <h2>Payment for {event.name}</h2>
      
      <Shift4PaymentComponent
        amount={event.totalAmount}
        eventId={event.id}
        eventName={event.name}
        clientEmail={client.email}
        onPaymentSuccess={handlePaymentSuccess}
        onPaymentError={handlePaymentError}
        isTestMode={true} // Set to false for production
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### **Integration with EventForm:**

```javascript
// In EventForm.js, add payment section
import Shift4PaymentComponent from './Shift4PaymentComponent';

// Add to your EventForm component
const [showPayment, setShowPayment] = useState(false);

const handlePaymentSuccess = (paymentData) => {
  // Add payment to event's financial records
  setFormData(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    financials: {
      ...prev.financials,
      payments: [...prev.financials.payments, paymentData]
    }
  }));
  
  toast.success('Payment processed successfully!');
  setShowPayment(false);
};

// In your render function:
{showPayment && (
  <div className="payment-section">
    <Shift4PaymentComponent
      amount={formData.financials.total}
      eventId={event?.id || 'new'}
      eventName={formData.eventName}
      clientEmail={formData.clientInfo.email}
      onPaymentSuccess={handlePaymentSuccess}
      onPaymentError={(error) => toast.error(`Payment failed: ${error}`)}
      isTestMode={true}
    />
  </div>
)}
```

## ⚙️ **Configuration**

### **Environment Variables:**

Add to your `.env.local` file:

```env
# Shift4 Configuration
REACT_APP_SHIFT4_PUBLIC_KEY=your_production_public_key_here
REACT_APP_SHIFT4_SECRET_KEY=your_production_secret_key_here
```

### **Test Mode vs Production:**

- **Test Mode (`isTestMode={true}`)**: Uses Shift4 sandbox environment
- **Production Mode (`isTestMode={false}`)**: Uses live Shift4 environment

### **Test Card Numbers:**

For testing purposes, use these card numbers:

- **Success**: 4242 4242 4242 4242
- **Decline**: 4000 0000 0000 0002
- **Insufficient Funds**: 4000 0000 0000 9995

## 🔧 **Backend Integration**

### **Security Note:**

The current implementation includes a mock `createCheckoutRequest` function. For production, you **MUST** implement this on your backend:

```javascript
// Backend endpoint example (Node.js/Express)
app.post('/api/create-checkout-request', async (req, res) => {
  const { amount, eventId, clientEmail } = req.body;
  
  try {
    const shift4 = require('shift4-node')(process.env.SHIFT4_SECRET_KEY);
    
    const checkoutRequest = await shift4.checkoutRequests.create({
      charge: {
        amount: amount * 100, // Convert to cents
        currency: 'USD',
        description: `VH Banquets Event Payment`,
        metadata: {
          eventId,
          clientEmail
        }
      }
    });
    
    res.json({ checkoutRequest: checkoutRequest.id });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
  }
});
```

Then update the frontend `createCheckoutRequest` function:

```javascript
const createCheckoutRequest = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/create-checkout-request', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      amount,
      eventId,
      clientEmail
    })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return data.checkoutRequest;
};
```

## 📊 **Payment Data Structure**

When a payment succeeds, the component returns this data structure:

```javascript
{
  id: "shift4_1703123456789",
  chargeId: "charge_abc123",
  amount: 1250.00,
  description: "VH Banquets - Wedding Reception",
  email: "client@example.com",
  date: "2025-06-23T10:30:00.000Z",
  method: "credit_card",
  status: "completed"
}
```

## 🎨 **Styling**

The component uses Tailwind CSS classes and is fully responsive. Key styling features:

- **Professional Appearance**: Clean, modern design
- **Status Indicators**: Color-coded payment status
- **Loading States**: Spinner and disabled states during processing
- **Security Badges**: Trust indicators for user confidence
