# Banquet Application Development Roadmap

This roadmap outlines a phased approach to building the complete application, starting with the web version to perfect the features before extending to native mobile apps.

## Phase 1: Core Financial & Menu Integration (Web App)

**Goal:** To establish the core financial and menu planning capabilities, turning the application into a powerful quoting and management tool.

### 1. Build the Menu & Bar Module

- [x] Create the "Menu & Bar" tab within the event details
- [x] Develop an interactive form where you can add appetizers, dinners, and bar packages from your Private Event Packet
- [x] The system will automatically calculate the total estimated cost based on guest count and selections

### 2. Implement Financial Tracking

- [x] Create a new "Financials" tab for each event
- [x] This tab will show the auto-calculated quote from the menu selections
- [x] Add functionality to log payments (e.g., "$500 Deposit Paid") and track the remaining balance

### 3. Enhance the Client Database

- [x] Create a main "Clients" section in the dashboard to view and manage all your clients and their event history in one place

---

## Phase 2: Operations & Staff Management (Web App)

**Goal:** To streamline the internal process for executing an event, ensuring your staff has all the information they need.

### 1. Develop Dynamic Event Sheets

- [x] Create a feature to automatically generate a digital, printable "Chef Event Sheet" and "Server Event Sheet"
- [x] These sheets will pull all the data directly from the "Planning" and "Menu" tabs, ensuring they are always accurate and up-to-date

### 2. Build the Interactive Timeline

- [x] Implement the "Timeline" tab with a tool to create a detailed schedule for the event (e.g., Staff Arrival, Guest Arrival, Dinner Service, etc.)

### 3. Basic Staff Scheduling

- [x] Add a simple feature within the event details to assign specific staff members (servers, bartenders) to the event

## Phase 3: Client-Facing Portal & Legal (Web App)

**Goal:** To enhance the client experience and finalize the booking and contract process.

### 1. Create a Secure Client Portal

- [ ] Develop a secure, read-only view for your clients
- [ ] Clients will be able to log in and see their event's planning details, menu, timeline, and financial summary
- [ ] Reduce back-and-forth communication

### 2. Integrate Digital Contract & Signing

- [ ] Build out the "Contract" tab to automatically generate the full legal contract using all the event data
- [ ] Integrate the digital signature functionality we created earlier
- [ ] Allow the client to sign the final contract directly within their portal

---

## Phase 4: Native Mobile App Development (iOS & Android)

**Goal:** To take the complete and perfected web application and deliver it as a high-performance native app for mobile devices.

### 1. Adapt UI for Mobile

- [ ] Use React Native to create a mobile-friendly version of the dashboard, event details, and planning tabs

### 2. Port Core Features

- [ ] Ensure all the core functionality (viewing events, editing planning details, checking financials) works seamlessly on the mobile apps

### 3. Implement Native-Specific Features

- [ ] Add mobile-only features like push notifications to remind you of an upcoming final payment deadline or a new client inquiry

---

## Phase 5: Advanced Features & Final Polish

**Goal:** To add powerful, high-end features that make the application a best-in-class management tool.

### 1. Interactive Floor Plan Editor

- [ ] Upgrade the floor plan from a static image to a fully interactive drag-and-drop editor where you can lay out your room

### 2. High-Level Reporting Dashboard

- [ ] Create a main dashboard with charts and graphs showing key business metrics like monthly revenue, booking trends, and most popular menu items

### 3. Inventory Management

- [ ] Build the module to track your physical inventory of linens, tables, chairs, and other equipment
