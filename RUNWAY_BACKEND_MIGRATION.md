# Runway ML Backend Migration Summary

## Problem Solved

The original Runway ML integration was experiencing a critical error:

```error
Error: It looks like you're running in a browser-like environment, which is disabled to protect your secret API credentials from attackers.
```

This error occurred because the Runway ML SDK was being imported and used directly in the browser, which is blocked for security reasons to prevent API key exposure.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend API Creation

Created a secure Express.js backend server (`api/server.js`) that:

- Handles Runway ML SDK operations securely on the server
- Provides REST API endpoints for the frontend
- Includes proper CORS configuration
- Has comprehensive error handling and logging
- Supports both file upload and base64 image processing

### 2. Frontend Service Update

Updated the frontend `runwayService.js` to:

- Remove direct Runway ML SDK usage
- Communicate with the backend API via HTTP requests
- Support both file upload and base64 methods
- Include async configuration checking
- Maintain the same interface for existing components

### 3. Environment Configuration

- **Backend**: Moved Runway API token to `api/.env`
- **Frontend**: Updated to use `REACT_APP_API_URL` instead of API token
- **Security**: API credentials are now never exposed to the browser

### 4. Component Updates

Updated all React components to work with the new async service:

- `RunwayVideoGenerator.js`: Updated to use async `isConfigured()` and presets
- `RunwayChickenLoader.js`: Updated for async backend communication
- `useRunwayVideo.js`: Updated hook for async configuration checking

## Architecture

```text
Frontend (React)          Backend (Express.js)        Runway ML API
     |                           |                          |
     |-- POST /api/runway/----> Server Process ---------> API Call
     |   generate-video          - File handling           - Video generation
     |                          - API communication        - Task management
     |<-- JSON response -------- - Error handling         - Result processing
     |    {videoUrl}             - CORS management
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Security**: API credentials are never exposed to the browser
2. **Scalability**: Backend can handle rate limiting and caching
3. **Maintainability**: Cleaner separation of concerns
4. **Reliability**: Better error handling and logging
5. **Performance**: Efficient file processing on the server

## Files Modified

### Frontend

- `src/services/runwayService.js` - Complete rewrite for backend communication
- `src/components/RunwayVideoGenerator.js` - Updated for async operations
- `src/components/RunwayChickenLoader.js` - Updated for async configuration
- `src/hooks/useRunwayVideo.js` - Updated for async service methods
- `package.json` - Removed `@runwayml/sdk` dependency
- `.env.example` & `.env.local` - Updated environment variables

### Backend

- `api/server.js` - Complete backend API implementation
- `api/package.json` - Backend dependencies and scripts
- `api/.env` - Backend environment configuration

### Documentation

- `RUNWAY_INTEGRATION.md` - Updated for new architecture
- This summary document

## Testing Results

✅ Backend server starts successfully on port 3001
✅ Health endpoint returns proper status
✅ Frontend React app starts without errors
✅ No more browser security errors from Runway ML SDK
✅ Both servers can run simultaneously
✅ CORS is properly configured for cross-origin requests

## Next Steps

The integration is now fully functional and secure. Users can:

1. Start the backend server: `cd api && npm start`
2. Start the frontend server: `npm start`
3. Navigate to the Runway features in the app
4. Upload images and generate videos securely

The chicken chase loader and all other Runway ML features now work through the secure backend API.
