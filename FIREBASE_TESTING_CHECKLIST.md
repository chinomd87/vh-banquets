## 🔍 Debugging Tips

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Browser Console** (F12):
   - Look for Firebase authentication messages
   - Check for any red error messages
   - Verify Firebase connection logs

2. **Check Firebase Console**:
   - Authentication: Should show anonymous users
   - Firestore: Should show new documents under `artifacts/vh-banquets-app/users/`
   - Storage: Should show uploaded files

3. **Common Issues**:
   - **CORS errors**: Make sure your domain is added to Firebase Auth domains
   - **Permission denied**: Check Firestore rules are set correctly
   - **File upload fails**: Verify Storage rules allow uploads

## 🚀 Expected Results

After successful testing, you should see:

### In Your App

- Events created and displayed
- Files uploaded and accessible
- Real-time data synchronization
- All features working smoothly

### In Firebase Console

- **Authentication**: Anonymous users appearing
- **Firestore**: Data structure like:

```text
artifacts/
  vh-banquets-app/
    users/
      {userId}/
        events/
          {eventId}/ → Your test events
```

- **Storage**: Uploaded files in `events/{userId}/` folders

## 🎯 Next Steps After Testing

1. **Set Production Security Rules** (when ready to deploy)
2. **Add proper error handling** for edge cases
3. **Consider adding admin authentication** for staff users
4. **Set up Firebase Analytics** (optional)
5. **Configure Firebase Hosting** for deployment

## 📊 Performance Notes

Your app is configured for:

- **Offline support**: Firebase handles offline data caching
- **Real-time updates**: Changes sync across devices instantly  
- **Scalable architecture**: Can handle multiple concurrent users
- **Secure data access**: Each user only sees their own data
